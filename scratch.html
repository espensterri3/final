            Martin Ødegaard (born 17 December 1998) is a Norwegian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for
            and captains both Premier League club Arsenal and the Norway national team. Considered one of the best
            midfielders in the world, he is known for his technique, dribbling ability, vision and range of passing.
            <br><br>
            On 11 February 2024, in a 6–0 away win against West Ham, Ødegaard became the first player on record since
            2003–04 to complete 100+ passes (107), create at least five chances (7), and assist multiple goals (2) in
            the same Premier League match.[111] On 12 March, he played a crucial role in leading Arsenal to a 1–1 on
            agg., 4–2 on penalties victory over Porto, providing the assist for Arsenal's equaliser in the tie and
            helping to seal their progression to the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time in 14
            years.[112] On 23 April, Ødegaard was instrumental in a 5–0 home victory against Chelsea, assisting their
            third and fifth goals, and became the first Arsenal player since Mesut Özil to create eight chances from
            open play in a Premier League match.[113][114] He ended the season as the player with the most chances
            created from open play in the 2023–24 Premier League season, with 88. Ødegaard was confirmed as Arsenal's
            Player of the Season following the end of the season, winning the award for the second time in a row.
